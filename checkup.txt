React-Rails Demo Application
This repo is an example of a simple working Rails 5, Webpack(er)3, React-Rails 2.3+ application.

Where generators are used, the git commit will be the command ran to get to the current application state so it will hopefully be easy to follow along at home.

How to test the Demo Application
1) Install the JS packages:
$ yarn # or npm install
2) In one terminal run the rails server:
$ rails s
3) In another terminal run the webpack server:
$ ./bin/webpack-dev-server
4) Visit the welcome page
http://localhost:3000/welcome/index
